* The system will read in a set size k, and find the minimal product-sum number.

* A minimal product-sum number is a natural number N, that can be written as the sum and product of the given set of at least two natural numbers. 

* Example input/output:

  Input "4"

  Output "8 = 1 x 1 x 2 x 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4"

  IO w/ Delimiters 4:8.1|1|2|4/1,1,2,4;

  - Delimiter Notation:
  
  -Add ","

  -Multiply "|"

  -Separate Input/Output ":"

  -Separate N from Add/Mult "."

  -Output ";"
